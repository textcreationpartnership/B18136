            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

And such all the <hi>Ministers</hi> of Christ either are, or ought to be; as <hi>Boaner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>'s (a sirname given by our Saviour to the two Sons of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> two of his Apostles,
<pb facs="tcp:192573:3"/>
               <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> his Brother, Mark <hi>3.17.) Sons of thunder,</hi> preaching powerfully and vehemently, thundring out the threatnings of the <hi>Law</hi> against the transgressors of it; So <hi>Barnabas's, Sons of Consolation,</hi> able and ready to speak comfort to whom comfort belongeth, which is one, and a chief part of their office to do. <hi>Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God; Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem,</hi> &amp;c. (a Speech directed in special to the <hi>Prophets</hi> of God) Isa. <hi>40.1, 2.</hi> And such a one it hath been my desire and indeavour in my Ministerial ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice amongst you, to approve my self unto God and you: And my desire yet is, that I might be further serviceable to you in the same way. To which end, having revised what was divers years since held forth to some of you from the <hi>Pulpit,</hi>

I have entitled it <hi>Aqua Coelestis,</hi> a <hi>Cordial Water,</hi> distilled and dropped from <hi>Heaven,</hi> issuing out of the Mouth of him, who is (as the Apostle stileth him, Rom. <hi>15.5.</hi>) <gap reason="foreign">

<pb facs="tcp:192573:3"/>Spirits under the saddest and sorest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts.</hi> And such use I shall advise and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire you, who finde your selves to stand in need of such a <hi>Cordial,</hi> to make of it. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts,</hi> in some kind or other, you must make account to meet with. And your spirits being in themselves weak, you will have need of somewhat to support them. Which not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon <hi>earth,</hi> your onely way is to look up to <hi>heaven</hi> for it. Now from thence you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect ought that may be useful to you in this way, but what is held forth to you in this one word, <hi>Grace.</hi> To this it is that you owe what ever you have, or are; and upon this you depend for whatever you hope for. By this it is that you were, before you were, <hi>Elected,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Redeemed.</hi> By this it is that you are <hi>Justified, Adopted,</hi> and <hi>made accepted in the beloved.</hi> By this it is that you are <hi>Sanctified</hi> here, and shall be <hi>Glorified</hi> hereafter; all being streams flowing from this one fountain, <hi>issues of grace</hi> (as you have it fully declared by the Apostle in that one Chapter, Eph. <hi>1.</hi>) And by the help and assistance of this it is that you must be <hi>supported</hi> in your journey to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and carried on through the whole course of your <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Passive</hi> obedience. Which being of such an universal concernment for
<pb facs="tcp:192573:4"/>your Spiritual and Eternal Welfare, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire is, that your eyes may ever be fixed upon it, so as making sure your interest in it, you may upon all occasious have recourse unto it for the supply of your wants; <hi>bringing</hi> your <hi>Pitchers</hi> to the <hi>Well</hi> (as that Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> did hers to <hi>Jacobs,</hi> Joh. <hi>4.7.</hi>) and <hi>leaving</hi> them there (as she did hers, v. <hi>28.</hi>) which whilest you do, be you comfortably as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, that, being <hi>empty vessels</hi> (as hers was) they shall be <hi>filled.</hi> Being sensible of your own wants and weaknesses, Come, and <hi>Come boldly</hi> (as the Apostle directs and exhorts, Heb. <hi>4. ult.) to the throne of Grace, that you may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in the time of need.</hi> Which whilest you do in the name of <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ, <hi>by whom you have accesse by faith unto this grace wherein you stand</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> tells his <hi>Romans,</hi> Rom. <hi>5.2.</hi>) Now doubt not of receiving that <hi>Spirit of grace</hi> (which <hi>God,</hi> your <hi>heavenly Father</hi> is more ready to <hi>give to those that ask him,</hi> then <hi>earthly Parents</hi> are to give good gifts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their <hi>children</hi> (as your Saviour assures you. Luke <hi>11.13.</hi>) for the supporting and strengthening of you; so as by the assistance thereof you shall be inabled, not onely to <hi>stand,</hi> but to <hi>walk</hi> on in your way (as <hi>Elias</hi>

                  <hi>he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth Covenant and mercy with them that love him &amp;c.</hi> Deut. 7.9. <hi>God is faithful.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.9.

And being so, he will hear and answer the prayers of his people, such as are in Covenant with him. It is the Argument which <hi>David</hi> makes use of to move his <hi>God</hi> to do that for him; Psal. 143.1. <hi>In thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness.</hi>] In thy <hi>faithfulness,</hi> according to thy promise; and in thy <hi>righteousness,</hi> according to the equity of my cause. So it is, God hath engaged himself by <hi>Promise</hi> to hear and answer the prayers of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>He shall call upon me, and I will answer him;</hi> Psal. 91.15. <hi>It shall come to passe, that before they call I will answer, and while they are yet speaking I will hear,</hi>] it is the Promise which the Lord maketh to his people in Gospel times, <hi>Isa.</hi> 65.24. They shall not be so forward to crave as I to grant, nor so ready to ask, as I to hear, and answer. Many such Promises we meet withal in the Book of God. Now these Promises being passed, it standeth with Gods faithfulness to make performance of them. And upon that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:192573:8"/>account he will not suffer his people to lie too long under their burdens, or to be overburdened by them. <hi>God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that yee are able</hi> (so <hi>Paul</hi> telleth his <hi>Corinthians</hi>) 1 Cor. 10.13. But he will hear their prayers, and answer them. <hi>He is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that promised,</hi> Heb. 10.23.</p>
               <p>Thus you see that it is so, and why it is so. <hi>God</hi> being <hi>Gracious</hi> and <hi>Faithful,</hi> as his graciousness inclines him, so his faithfulness (as we may say) bindes him to do the like for other of his faithful servants, which here he doth to this his Apostle; in his time to return an <hi>Answer,</hi> and a <hi>gracious Answer</hi> to their Prayers.</p>
               <p>Which (to make some <hi>Application</hi> of it brie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly) let it serve to buoye and bear up the hearts and spirits of all the Lords people under what ever affliction or suffering God shall please to exercise them with. They being a <hi>praying people,</hi>

But this their suit he (knowing that their labour would be but in vain, and to no purpose) would not hearken to. <hi>And he said, ye shall not send:</hi> v. 16. yet being importuned by them, he yields to them. <hi>When they urged him till he was ashamed</hi> (as the next verse hath it) (ashamed that he should seem inexorable) <hi>he said, Send.</hi> Thus are <hi>men</hi> oft-times overcome by the importunity of their unwearied suitors and supplicants, being

At the length he prevailed with him; Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his name was changed from <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Israel,</hi> (as we find it v. 28.) <hi>And he said thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel, for as a Prince hast thou power with God, &amp;c.</hi> Now in what way was it that he thus wrestled with his God, so as thus to prevail with him? why it was not barely in a <hi>corporal,</hi> but in a <hi>spiritual</hi> way, by his <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Tears.</hi> So the Prophet <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sea</hi> expounds it, <hi>Hos.</hi> 12.3, 4. where speaking of <hi>Jacob,</hi> he saith, <hi>By his strength he had power with God, yea he had power over the Angel</hi> (that is, the <hi>Angel of the Covenant,</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi> is called, <hi>Malac.</hi> 3.1.) <hi>and prevailed, he wept and made supplication unto him.</hi> By this means it was that

And will importunity prevail so much with <hi>men,</hi> who like it not? what will it do, or rather what will it not do, with <hi>God,</hi> who approveth of it, and is so well pleased with it, that he requireth it from those who are suitors unto him, putting the issue of their speeding upon it? Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count then come we to our God, praying unto him after this manner, with a holy and humble importunity. So doing, now doubt not of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Answer, of receiving what we pray for. For which we have our Saviours assurance there in the verses following, v. 9, 10. <hi>And I say unto you, Ask and it shall be given you, seek and ye shall find, knock and it shall be opened unto you; for every one that asketh receiveth, and he that seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth findeth, and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.</hi> Provided, that what is asked, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of God, and that his time be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:192573:12"/>tarried and waited for (of which I shall speak more anon.)</p>
               <p>Which (to draw towards a conclusion of this point) let it both put us upon <hi>praying,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Christians to be instant in Prayer.</note> and being <hi>instant</hi> in it, in seeking of God both for <hi>our selves</hi> and <hi>others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For <hi>our selves,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">For themselves.</note> for the obtaining of some mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which we want, for the removal of some evil which we feel, or the diverting of some judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which we fear; In these cases, if God do not answer our prayers at the first, yet hold on, pray again and again; pray (as our Apostle here did) <hi>Thrice,</hi> frequently and earnestly.</p>
               <p>And what we do for our selves,
<note place="margin">For others who stand charged upon their prayers.

And these I hope many of us have afforded. I, but as yet we have not received such an Answer as we have desired and expected. Still our divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and distractions are continued (if not increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) our <hi>Breaches</hi> are not healed, but rather grow wider and wider. Now in this case what shall we do? what lay our hands upon our mouths, and keep silence? Not so. <hi>Ye that make mention of the Lord</hi> (or <hi>are the Lords remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancers,</hi> as our margin readeth it) <hi>keep not si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth;</hi> (so the Prophet calleth upon Gods servants, his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and others, to do) <hi>Isa.</hi> 62.7. willing them
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:192573:13"/>to be instant and earnest with their God in the behalf of his Church, to be incessant in their prayers for it, for the restitution and settlement of it. And this let all that have a good will to <hi>Sion</hi> do; being (as we ought to be) deeply affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the calamities of the Church, be we importunate with our God in the behalf thereof, that he would please to settle and to establish it.

But herein they were much mistaken, as he there tells them; were that their Petition granted they would find the quite contrary, being expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to more and greater troubles and sufferings then others, more then they knew how to bear: <hi>Are ye able to drink of the Cup that I shall drink of, &amp;c.</hi> And truly so it is oft-times in the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and requests which Gods people put up unto him; whilest they ask such and such temporal blessings, they ask they know not what; they desire that, which if it were granted to them, they would have cause to repent of their prayers, that which would prove hurtful, if not baneful to them. Such were the <hi>Israelites Quailes</hi> to them, which they asking were given them, and that in great abundance, but what went in at their mouths <hi>came out at their nostrils</hi> (as <hi>Moses</hi> foretold them it should do, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.20.) they being therewith surfeited, so as they in a violent way came to vomit up what at the first was so pleasing to their palates. And so would it fare oft-times with Gods people, should he sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:192573:18"/>their desires, in granting what they pray for, it might prove very prejudicial to them, if not in a temporal, yet in a spiritual way, very detrimental as to their souls. Many a soul there is now in hell, which (if we speak according to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary causes) had never come there, had not God granted the desires of it in bestowing upon it such an abundance of outward things, as Riches and Honours, &amp;c. which oft-times prove bane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the possessors of them, as the <hi>Preacher</hi> tells us from his own observation, Eccl. 5.13. <hi>There is a sore evil which I have seen under the Sun,</hi> viz. <hi>Riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt;</hi> their temporal or spiritual hurt, whereof they were the occasions. And many a soul is now in heaven, which had not God cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the inordinate desires of it, by withholding from it what it would have had, it had never come there. Such is the weakness even of Gods own people in praying, that oftentimes they ask that, which if granted to them, they should (as I said) have cause to repent of.</p>

Thus God foresees what good or evil would redound unto his people, from what he

<note place="margin">His Gracious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> their Benefit; and thereupon it is that he doth not alwayes grant their requests, but sometimes answer them in some other way. <hi>Bonus Dominus,</hi>

                  <hi>qui saepe non tribuit quod volumus, ut tribuat quod mallemus</hi> (saith <hi>Jerom</hi> to his <hi>Paulinus.</hi>) Good and gracious is the Lord, who oft-times with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth that from his people which they would have, that so he may bestow upon them that which will be more welcome to them. A loving father will not give his child a knife, though it cry for it. Nor will God grant unto his children that which may be hurtful to them, though they earnestly desire it from him. But will do that, in way of Answer to their prayers, which he seeth to be most expedient for them. And hence it is that he seemeth sometimes to lend a deaf ear to their prayers; suffering them to lie and continue under some sharp affliction, not working delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for ahem, though earnestly importuned by them. Even as a <hi>Chyrurgeon</hi> deals with his <hi>Patient</hi> (it is <hi>Augustines</hi> similitude,
<note place="margin">

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:192573:19"/>be best for him. Even so dealt the Lord here with his servant <hi>Paul. Paul</hi> being in danger of a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <hi>Tympanie</hi> (as I shewed you before) of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inordinately lifted up through abundance of Revelations, for the preventing hereof the Lord exerciseth him with some sharp affliction. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he earnestly solicites him for a removal of it. But this request of his is not granted, the Lord not seeing it expedient for him. Onely in the mean time he giveth him a comfortable assurance of that which should be as good, nay better for him. <hi>My grace is sufficient for thee.</hi>

Such was <hi>Abraham's</hi> and <hi>Rachel's</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire after Children. <hi>Lord God, what wilt thou give me; seeing I go childless?</hi> (saith he) Gen. 15.2. <hi>Give me children, or else I dye</hi> (saith she to her husband <hi>Jacob</hi>) Gen. 30.1. Such is the impatience of some, and too many, their hearts running out after such, or such a blessing, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will content them but that. Let it not be so with us. Knowing that we have to deal with a wise and a good God, who knoweth better what is fit for us, then we for our selves, let us sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our wills to his will. So did our heavenly Pattern, the <hi>Lord Jesus,</hi> though he prayed <hi>thrice</hi> for the taking away of the bitter Cup, yet still it was with submission of his will to the will of his heavenly Father. <hi>If it be possible, let this Cup pass from me, Nevertheless not as I will,

And again, <hi>O my father, if this Cup may not pass from me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept I drink it, thy will be done,</hi> v. 42. <hi>And so he prayed the third time, using the same words,</hi> v. 44. Herein let every of us propound him as a Pattern for our imitation, following his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; In presenting our requests unto God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe up them, and our selves unto him, leaving our Petitions with him, to make what answer he shall think fit to return. Which receiving, now let us rest contented with it, and thankful for it. Looking upon it as no small grace and favour that we may have access to the throne of grace, and that our prayers may find audience and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God. And looking upon our selves as <hi>not worthy of all the mercies which he hath shewed unto us</hi> (as <hi>Jacob</hi> humbly confesseth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himself, Gen. 32.10.) now, though we fall short in our desires, wanting what we would have, yet bless God for what he is pleased to reach forth unto us.

Herein doth this grace and favour of his differ from that of earthly Kings and Princes, which is like themselves, mutable and changeable. Those whom they love to day, they may hate to morrow, (as <hi>Saul</hi> did <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. and <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> his <hi>Haman.</hi> Hest. 6.)

This God expecteth and requireth that we should do, and in obedience to his Commands see that we do it. <hi>When thou saidest, Seek ye my face, my heart said unto thee, Thy face, Lord, I will seek,</hi> (saith <hi>David</hi>) Psal. 27.8. So it is, God (as it were) holdeth forth his <hi>face,</hi> tendreth his grace and favour to those who will seek after it, and this he calleth upon them to do. Now to this call let all our

So <hi>David</hi> looked upon it, and therefore beggeth this above all, Psal. 4.6. <hi>There be many that say, who will shew us any good; Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.</hi> As for the multitude, the greatest part of men, their hearts were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out after the things of this world, <gap reason="foreign">

But <hi>David</hi> was of another mind, placing his felicity in <hi>Gods grace</hi> and favour, he prized that above all: yea even above his own <hi>life. Thy loving kindness is better than life,</hi> (saith he, being then in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness) <hi>Psal.</hi> 63.3. And so look we upon it, preferring this before all other things, seek we it (as I said) in the first place, that we may have an interest in it, and have some good assurance of it; that God would make known to us this our interest, evidencing his love, his peculiar love to us. This is that which the <hi>Spouse</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth her first request to her <hi>wellbeloved,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> to <hi>Christ,</hi> Cant. 1.2. <hi>Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth, for thy love is better than wine;</hi> desiring that he would give unto her more clear evidences of his grace &amp; favor, which would be more pleasing and cheering to her, than wine is to the palate and heart.

And so may it well be said in the want of whatever blessings; What? is not God better to us then they, or whatever else we can desire? <hi>Deus meus &amp; omnia,</hi> If God be ours, all is ours. <hi>All things are yours,</hi> (saith <hi>Paul</hi> to his believing <hi>Corinthians) whether things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, or things to come, all are yours,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.21, 22, 23. Having an interest in <hi>Christ,</hi> and so in the grace and favour of God through him, now all things were theirs, serving for their good and benefit. And let this be enough for us. <hi>It is enough,</hi> Joseph <hi>my Son is yet alive,</hi> (saith the aged <hi>Patriarch</hi>) Gen. 45. last. It was enough to content him, he being to him his dear son: And so let it be said to us; having the <hi>living God</hi> for <hi>our God,</hi> our tender and affectionate Father in Christ, let this be enough to us; having an interest in his grace, his peculiar love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, now in the midst of whatever wants, or sufferings we are exercised with, let this suffice and content us, as well it may. So the Lord is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:192573:25"/>apprehended by some here to speak unto his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Paul; Paul</hi> being in a sad conflict, under some temptation or vexation, he earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth to be freed from it: but the Lord returns him no other answer but this, <hi>My grace is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for thee:</hi> so willing him to rest satisfied and contented with this, yet he was a favourite of his, and consequently he would have an eye to him, to do that for him which would be most for his good.

And so the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle himself useth it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. where in one verse we find this word <hi>[Grace]</hi> used in a threefold sence: 1. For the <hi>good will</hi> and <hi>favour</hi> of God <hi>[By the grace of God I am that I am.]</hi> That he was not only a <hi>Christian,</hi> but an <hi>Apostle,</hi> an <hi>eminent Apostle,</hi> this he ascribes to the free grace of God, his meer good will. 2.

Then (3.) for the <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull assistance of Gods Spirit [But I laboured more abundantly then they all, yet not I, but the grace of God, which was with me;]</hi> a divine assistance going along with me in Preaching of the Gospel, giving me both will and power to do what I have done. And in such a sense is this word not unfitly looked in that Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. where <hi>Paul</hi> saith of his believing <hi>Romans,</hi> that they were <hi>not under the Law, but under Grace:</hi> not under the rigorous exaction of the Law, which requireth what it giveth no strength to perform, but under the gracious dispensation of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and under the <hi>Covenant of grace;</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an internal power given them, the spirit of God working effectually in them, and so ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling that in them which was required from them.

So it there followeth, v. 14. <hi>But I obtained mercy, &amp;c.

Thus was the grace of God sufficient for him, for his first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version. And what he found and felt in himself; the like had many others in his time done. Being in some kinds as bad, yea <hi>morally</hi> far worse then he, yet they had experience of the like sufficiency of this grace for the changing and renewing of them. So had divers in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> done; whom he mindeth of it, 1 Cor. 6.11.

They had found the grace of God sufficient for them, working effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually in them for the changing of them. And the like shall they do in whomsoever it undertaketh this work. It is that which the Lord saith he would do for his people, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> after their return from Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, Ezek. 36.25, 26. <hi>I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean, from all your filthiness, and from all your Idols will I cleanse you; A new heart also will I give you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them;</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising to communicate his grace unto them, which should be sufficient for them, working effectually in them for their Conversion, and Salvation. And so it is where ever it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated. It is that which the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> speaking in the person of <hi>God,</hi> saith he heard <hi>Ephraim,</hi> (the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> the ten Tribes) say unto him, Jer. 31.18. <hi>Turn thou mè, and I shall be turned;</hi> or (as the <hi>Geneva</hi> hath it,) <hi>Convert thou me, and I shall be converted;</hi> that is, give us grace to repent, and we shall repent.

Even so by their falls, their souls (it may be) contract a lameness, being (as it were) out of joynt, so as they do not walk in the wayes of God so vigorously as sometimes they did. But this grace of God is sufficient to cure, to set their souls in joynt again, and to cure their lameness. Such cures Christ wrought upon the <hi>Bodies</hi> of those that came unto him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>lame,</hi> he <hi>healed</hi> them; which he did by a <hi>word.</hi> And with like facility he is able to work the like cure upon the Souls of men; being become lame, he can heal them by the work of his Spirit, restoring them, being fallen, to former <hi>Rectitude.</hi>

Now in this case the grace of God is sufficient to work a cure
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:192573:41"/>upon them, by binding up these broken hearts. <hi>The spirit of the Lord is upon me, he hath sent me to bind up the broken hearted</hi> (saith the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi>) Cap. 61.1.

Thus as the <hi>Sun</hi> breaking forth, dissipates and scatters those dark clouds which before hid the face of it from the earth, so the Lord lifting up the light of his countenance upon his people, he can scatter those dark clouds of their sins, which have for a time hid his face from them, restoring comfort unto them. And this he maketh promise of that he will do to the penitent sinner. <hi>Isa.</hi> 57.18. <hi>I have seen his wayes, and will heal him, I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him. [I have seen his wayes,]</hi> his sinfull wayes and courses, wherein he hath walked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to me; yet upon his returning unto me, <hi>I will heal him,</hi> restoring comfort, the joy of my salvation unto him.

                  <note place="margin">Temptations deterring and and discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging.</note> Such is that <hi>opposition</hi> which the servants of God meet with in and from the world, having many stumbling blocks cast in their way, to stop or hinder them

But the grace of God is sufficient to bear up their Spirits, and to carry them on in their course in despite of all these. So it was to <hi>Paul,</hi> who had frequent experience of these kinds of <hi>Temptations,</hi> having (as he saith) <hi>fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings without,</hi> meeting with <hi>many Adversaries,</hi> (as he tells his <hi>Corinthians</hi>) 1 Cor. 16.9. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, many that opposed themselves against him. Some whereof were <hi>secret,</hi> others <hi>open.</hi> Such were the <hi>Jewes</hi> generally, whom we find withstanding him wherever he went; not only <hi>Blaspheming his Doctrine,</hi> which they did <hi>Act.</hi> 18.6. <hi>They opposed themselves and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed; speaking evil of that way before the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> (as we have it) <hi>Act.</hi> 19.9. that is, of the Doctrine of the Gospel which he preached; but also <hi>laying in wait for his Person,</hi> seeking to take away his life, as we find it often, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 25.3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea so inraged were some of them, that they engaged themselves by oath to do it; more then forty entring into conspiracy against him, <hi>banding together, and binding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves under a curse, saying that they would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eat nor drink till they had killed Paul,</hi> (as we have it) <hi>Act.</hi> 23.12. So many and so great were the dangers that he was continually exposed to; which could not but exceedingly affect him, causing fears and terrors to arise in his heart. Having such <hi>fightings without,</hi> well might he (as he saith) have <hi>terrors within.</hi> Yet in the midst of these Temptations, by the power of divine
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:192573:43"/>grace he was supported, his spirit was born up, the Lord comforting him. So St. <hi>Luke</hi> setteth it forth in his story, <hi>Act.</hi> 23.10, 11. When the people were so enraged against him, that he was in danger of being <hi>pulled in pieces</hi> by them, <hi>The night following the Lord stood by him and said, Be of good cheer Paul,</hi> &amp;c. And the like he did again when he was brought before <hi>Nero</hi> to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for his life, his friends all forsaking him, <hi>The Lord stood with him, and strengthened him,</hi> (as he himself tells <hi>Timothy</hi>) 2 Tim. 4.17. Thus was he comforted and strengthened by the power of divine grace, so as he was enabled to resist those <hi>Temptations,</hi> not giving way to his fears, but going on in his work. So he tells the Elders of <hi>Ephesus</hi> at <hi>Miletum,</hi> appealing to them, who could attest what he said, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.18, 19. <hi>Ye know</hi> (saith he) <hi>from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons, serving the Lord with all humility of mind; and with many tears and temptations which befel me by the lying in wait of the Jewes.</hi> Thus was the grace of God sufficient for him, bearing him up in these conflicts, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting him under these discouragements. And the like the Lord here tells him it was able to do for him in this condition wherein he now was. Being <hi>buffeted by a messenger of Satan,</hi> either <hi>Hymeneus,</hi> or <hi>Alexander the Coppersmith</hi> (as I I told you some conceive of it) or some other Instruments of Satan, who fought to do him all the mischief they could, creating to him a great deal of trouble and disquietment, in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:192573:44"/>the Lord gives him to know that his <hi>grace was sufficient</hi> for him, to support and bear him up under this Temptation. And so other of the Saints of God have found it, who have had the like experience hereof, being after the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner strengthened and supported, so as they have not given way to inordinate fears and terrors in the midst of the greatest dangers. So was it with <hi>David,</hi> who bearing himself upon the strength of his God, was bold and confident, not fearing the machinations and designs of his enemies. <hi>The Lord is my light and my salvation</hi> (saith he) <hi>whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life, of whom shall I be afraid?</hi> Psal. 27.1 <hi>Though an Host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; though warr should rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, in this will I be confident,</hi> v. 3. So again, <hi>Psal.</hi> 56.4. <hi>In God have I put my trust, I will not fear what man can do unto me.</hi> Which he repeats <hi>v.</hi> 11. as also Psal. 118.6. <hi>The Lord is on my side, I will not fear what man can do unto me.</hi> And what he said, it is no other then what all true believers, who have an interest in God, having him for their God, may say, and that with like confidence that he did. So much the Apostle tells them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5, 6. <hi>The Lord hath said, I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee;</hi> So that we may boldly say, <hi>The Lord is my help, I will not fear what man shall do unto me.</hi> Such is the power of Divine Grace, that it is sufficient to bear up the hearts and spirits of the servants of God, in the midst of whatever <hi>deterring and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging Temptations,</hi> so as they shall not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by them.</p>

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:192573:48"/>to <hi>Grace,</hi> but <hi>Nature,</hi> may well be concluded to be <hi>Diabolical Injections.</hi> Such Temptations are Gods dear servants sometimes exercised with, which it may be, come upon them in so violent a way, that they know not how to resist them; but the more they strive against them, the more they are troubled with them; being like a <hi>Ball,</hi> which the more strongly it is cast against the wall, the more strongly it reboundeth back upon the face of him that threw it. So fareth it oft-times with these <hi>Temptations,</hi> the more earnestly they are resisted, the more violent they are. And being so, this must needs be a sad <hi>Conflict.</hi> So it was with this our Apostle, who is most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably conceived to have been exercised in some such kind. <hi>The Messenger Satan,</hi> (as the words in the Original may well be looked upon, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Angelus Satan</hi>) the <hi>Devil</hi> being <hi>Gods Messenger,</hi> he was sent to <hi>buffet him,</hi> by divine permission being let loose upon him to assault him with some foul and dangerous temptation, with which he had a sore conflict, it being to him as a <hi>thorne in his flesh,</hi> causing great vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and disquietment. And the like <hi>Conflicts</hi> have many of the dear Saints and servants of God been exercised with, sad <hi>Conflicts.</hi> But even in these the <hi>grace</hi> of God is sufficient for them. So the Lord here tells his servant <hi>Paul, My grace is sufficient for thee:</hi> Though he did not grant his <hi>Request,</hi> in giving him a <hi>Quietus est,</hi> freeing him from his trouble, by causing the evil Spirit to depart from him, yet he promiseth so to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie him by his grace against that wicked fiend,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:192573:48"/>that he should not prevail against him, but that he should so stand it out as to come off a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querer. And such is the <hi>sufficiency of Divine grace;</hi> that it is able to do the like for others. Though in themselves weak and infirm crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, no wayes able to wrestle with this <hi>Goliah,</hi> yet through the assistance thereof inwardly strengthening them, they shall be able to grapple with, and in the end come off, as <hi>David</hi> did triumphing over him. So much is intimated by our Apostle in that Text forecited, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.16. where directing Christians concerning their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual warfare; he bids them among other things to make special use of the shield of faith. <hi>Above all taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the Devil.</hi> Such a fence is a good <hi>shield</hi> to a Soldier, let there be never so many darts cast at him, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing held forth will secure him against them all. And this will <hi>faith</hi> do to a Christian, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised aright, laying hold upon Christ, and fetching strength from him, it will be as a <hi>shield</hi> to him, defending him against all temptations; so as though he may be assaulted and infested with them, yet he shall not be overcome by them.</p>
               <p>But there are yet another sort of Temptations,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> which are soarer then these;
<note place="margin">Divine Dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lictions.</note> and these are <hi>Divine Derelictions, Spiritual Desertions;</hi> when God seemeth to withdraw his assistance, hiding his face from the soul in these conflicts, seemingly leaving it to it self. Of this Temptation our blessed Saviour himself had experience; whom
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:192573:49"/>we may hear crying out upon the Cross, <hi>Eli, Eli, Lama-sabacthani, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> And the like had <hi>David,</hi> who was therein (as in many other things) a Type of Christ. Him also we hear complaining after the same manner, in the very same words, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.1. <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken me? Why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?</hi> And the like have many other of the dear Saints and Servants of God had, and frequently have. Now this cannot but be to them a <hi>sad Conflict.</hi> When the <hi>Sun</hi> hideth its face, there must needs be dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness upon the earth: And so when <hi>God</hi> hideth his face, it must needs be sad with the soul. So it was with <hi>David, Thou didst hide thy face,</hi> (saith he) <hi>and I was troubled,</hi> Psal. 30.7. And so was it with our blessed <hi>Saviour,</hi> who upon this account tells his Disciples, that <hi>his soul was exceeding sorrowfull, even unto death,</hi> Mat. 26.38. And upon the Cross he complains more of this, than all other his torments. But as sad as it is, yet such is the sufficiency of this grace, that it is able to support and bear up the spirit under it. So it did our blessed <hi>Saviour,</hi> who in the midst of that desertion, was inwardly strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and supported by the divine <hi>Spirits</hi> dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in him, so as though the sense and feeling of his Fathers love for a time failed him, yet so did not his <hi>faith,</hi> which he manifested by calling him his God; <hi>My God, my God.</hi> And of like power is the same <hi>spirit,</hi> the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>grace;</hi> which dwelling in the hearts of true believers,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:192573:49"/>(though not after the same manner that it did in Christ, in whom it dwelt (as the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth it, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9.) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Bodily,</hi> that is, <hi>Essentially;</hi> yet truly and <hi>Really</hi> in regard of the vertue and operation of it) it is able in a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret way to support them whilst it doth not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest it self unto them. Such a support it is that the Lord here maketh promise of to his servant <hi>Paul;</hi> though he seemed to hide his face from him in not hearkening to his prayer, not grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he so earnestly desired, yet he giveth him to know that his <hi>grace was sufficient</hi> for him, and so should be <hi>efficient</hi> in him, for the upholding of him in that Conflict, and giving him a happy issue out of it. Such is the power of this <hi>Grace,</hi> that hereby a Christian may be enabled to <hi>wrestle even with God</hi> himself. So was <hi>Jacob,</hi> who <hi>wrestled with the Angel,</hi> (the Angel of the Covenant) and <hi>prevailed</hi> with him. Upon which account (as you heard) his name was changed from <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Israel: Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel, for as a Prince hast thou power with God, and with men, and hast prevailed,</hi> Gen. 32.28. A strange and incredible thing, that a poor <hi>worm</hi> (so <hi>Jacob</hi> is called, <hi>Isa.</hi> 41.14.) should not only <hi>strive</hi> with his <hi>Maker,</hi> but <hi>conquer</hi> him: Yet this did <hi>Jacob:</hi> But how? not by any strength of his own, but by a divine assistance, the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upholding him in that conflict, and in the end, yielding to be overcome by him. Such is the sufficiency of this <hi>grace,</hi> that it is able thus to support the soul in whatever <hi>Conflicts,</hi> to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:192573:50"/>keep it from <hi>sinking.</hi> Even as <hi>Peter</hi> was born up by the help of his Master, so as he came to him <hi>walking upon the waves of the Sea,</hi> Mat. 14.29: Even so are believers by the power of divine grace and assistance, born up upon the waves of whatever <hi>Temptations,</hi> so as not to sink under them: However through the weakness of their faith they may begin to sink, (as <hi>Peter</hi> there did <hi>v.</hi> 30.) be in danger of perishing; yet Christ reaching forth his hand to them (as there he did to him) they shall be supported. And thus have I done with the first of these particulars, the first thing which <hi>this grace</hi> of God is sufficient to enable his people to, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>wrestle with and resist Temptations.</hi> Upon which I have insisted the longer, the Text leading me more directly to it than to the rest. Of which more briefly.</p>
               <p>In the 2d.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> place, as this grace is sufficient to enable Christians to resist Temptations,
<note place="margin">Work to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> so to <hi>subdue Corruption,</hi> the corruption of sinfull nature, the <hi>Flesh.</hi> This is one of a Christians <hi>Enemies,</hi> and that of all other the most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; in as much as it is <hi>within</hi> him, lying in his own bosome, ready to betray him into the hands of those his other enemies, the <hi>Divel,</hi> and the <hi>World.</hi> These are Enemies <hi>without,</hi> the <hi>Flesh</hi> an Enemy <hi>within;</hi> which is ready to open the door to them, and to comply with them in letting in, and giving entertainment to their Temptations, without which, they could not take place, and become effectual. <hi>Every man is tempted</hi> (saith St. <hi>James) when he is drawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of his own lust, and enticed,</hi> Jam. 1.14.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:192573:50"/>Here is the source and original of all Temptation unto sin, mans natural <hi>Corruption;</hi> without which, neither the <hi>World</hi> nor the <hi>Devil</hi> could hurt him, they tempting by working upon mans own <hi>Concupiscence.</hi> Hence it was that the Devils fiery darts which he cast at our blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> could do him no hurt, because he found nothing in him. <hi>The Prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me,</hi> Joh. 14.30. He did not find the like <hi>tinder</hi> of sinfull <hi>Concupiscence</hi> in him, as in others; so as those sparks could not take fire, his Temptations could take no place with him: upon this account there is no <hi>Enemy</hi> so dangerous as this, the <hi>Flesh.</hi> And with this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy the best of Saints have many sad and sore conflicts. <hi>Corruption</hi> still dwelling in them; though not <hi>reigning</hi> (as it doth in unregenerate persons, who are <hi>in the flesh,</hi> in their natural state and condition, and nothing but <hi>Flesh</hi>) yet still it <hi>dwelleth</hi> in them, <hi>It is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me</hi> (saith <hi>Paul</hi>) Rom. 7.17, 20. Still there is a remainder of sinfull Corruption in the best. And thus dwelling in them, it is continually <hi>working</hi> in them, and <hi>warring</hi> against them. So <hi>Paul</hi> found it in his own experience; <hi>Regenerate Paul;</hi> However he <hi>delighted in the Law of God after the inward man,</hi> (the <hi>new-man</hi>) (as he there saith) <hi>v.</hi> 22. Yet (saith he in the verse following) <hi>I see another Law in my mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers warring against the Law of my mind.</hi> This did sinfull Corruption, which was continually working in him; <hi>opposing</hi> and <hi>hindring</hi> him in the doing of what was good. <hi>I find then a Law</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:192573:51"/>(the <hi>Law of sin) that when I would do good, evil is present with me,</hi> v. 21. <hi>viz.</hi> to stop and hinder him in what he desired and in ended, and putting him upon what was evil. <hi>The good which I would I do not, but the evil which I would not, that I do,</hi> v. 19. Thus did the <hi>Law in his members,</hi> the Law of sin in his unregenerate part, <hi>warr a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Law of his mind,</hi> the Law of grace in his regenerate part. And the like experience have the best of Saints, in whom Corruption is continually working after the same manner; <hi>hindring</hi> them in the course of their obedience, being to them as a <hi>weight,</hi> or a <hi>net,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle compareth it, <hi>Heb</hi> 12.1. <hi>Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin that doth so easily beset us,</hi> speaking (as some understand it) of Original Corruption, which lying heavy upon the soul, entangleth it, hindring it in its journey to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And hindring from what is good, it <hi>insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gateth</hi> to what is evil. <hi>The spirit that is in us lusteth to envy</hi> (saith St. <hi>James</hi>) cap. 4.5. the <hi>evil Spirit,</hi> which still keepeth a residence in the best, inclineth them to that, and other the like sinfull Passions and Affections, which by the power of grace they resist. Thus have they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Conflicts with this <hi>Enemy;</hi> which are to them <hi>sore and sad Conflicts.</hi> So they were to <hi>Paul;</hi> whom we may hear passionately crying out, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. <hi>O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> or, <hi>this Body of death,</hi> meaning that <hi>Body of sin.</hi> (as before he called it, <hi>Cap.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 6.) This being still in him, it was to him like a <hi>dead Body</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:192573:51"/>tyed to a <hi>living,</hi> which by the ill savour of it maketh the man weary of his life: so was he, being wearied out with these continual conflicts. And what he had experience of, the like have all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the servants of God, being exercised with the like conflicts betwixt the <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>Spirit. The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, and these are contrary the one to the other, so that ye cannot do the things which ye would;</hi>) so <hi>Paul</hi> telleth his <hi>Galathians</hi>) Gal. 5.17. Such an unwearied Enemy is the <hi>Flesh</hi> to them, which striving so continually and so impetuously as it doth, they are not able of themselves to stand out against it, but are subject to be worsted by it. So was <hi>Paul,</hi> who sheweth how by that <hi>Law in his members warring against the Law of his mind,</hi> he was <hi>brought into Captivity to the Law of sin,</hi> Rom. 7.28. He was thereby, though against his will, drawn inevitably into sin, to do the evil which he would not. And so fareth it with the best of Saints; the stoutest Champions are subject to be foiled by this Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: And if so, how then shall poor weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians be able to withstand it? Yes, such is the <hi>sufficiency of Divine grace,</hi> that it is able to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them in these conflicts, and to enable them to conquer and subdue this <hi>Enemy.</hi> Hereof that <hi>chosen vessel,</hi> the blessed Apostle, had comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able experience in himself, who after that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate complaint which he had made of that <hi>Body of death,</hi> which so infested him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

And the like <hi>sufficiency of grace</hi> there is for all true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; though <hi>Corruption</hi> in them be strong, strongly inclining them to some sinfull and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate lusts, yet by the power hereof they may be enabled to subdue them. It is that which the <hi>Church,</hi> among other things, comfortably as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sureth her self of, that God would do for her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had converted her to himself, he would then subdue her iniquities, <hi>Mich</hi> 7.19. <hi>He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us, he will subdue our iniquities.</hi> Those sinfull lusts which formerly had tyrannized over them, should be brought into subjection to them. And this is Gods grace sufficient to do in and for his people, thus to subdue sinfull Corruption in them; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling them to <hi>bring</hi> it under, and <hi>keep</hi> it under.

And the like
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:192573:52"/>are Christians by the Spirit of grace enabled to do to the <hi>Body of sin</hi> in them, to <hi>bring</hi> it under, and <hi>keep</hi> it under.</p>

This is that which the Lord promiseth to do for his people, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. <hi>I will put my Spirit within you, and will cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.</hi> Such is the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace,</hi> the <hi>Gospel Covenant,</hi> (not like that of the <hi>Law,</hi> the <hi>Covenant of works,</hi> which like an <hi>Egyptian Task-master</hi> requireth the tale of brick, whilst it giveth no straw to make them with, exacting a perfect obedience to what it requireth, but giving no ability to perform it) a <hi>gracious Covenant.</hi> What God requireth from those who are under this Covenant, he enables them by his Grace and Spirit to yield an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical obedience to; so causing his people to walk in his way. Yea, such is the sufficiency
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:192573:54"/>of this grace, that be men never so weak in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, (as the best are) not able to stir or move, to set a foot in this way, yet it can enable them to run it. <hi>I will run the way of thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart</hi> (saith <hi>David</hi>) Psal. 119.32. Even as it is with a <hi>Clock,</hi> which being rusty or foul, it either moves not all, or very flowly; but being supplied with <hi>oyle,</hi> it runs glib: So doth the <hi>Soul;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anointed by this Spirit of grace, though dead and dull before, yet now it moveth vigorously, and goeth on cheerfully in the wayes of God, running after him. <hi>Draw me, and we will run after thee,</hi> (saith the <hi>Church</hi>) Cant. 1.4.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Yes, thy soul being truly humbled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee, now despair not, but hear God saying this unto thee, <hi>My grace is sufficient for thee.</hi> Sufficient, as to <hi>pardon</hi> thy <hi>sin,</hi> so to <hi>heal</hi> thy <hi>soul,</hi> to raise thee up, and set thee upon thy feet again, to restore thee to thy former health and comfort.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> To this I have (as I remember) return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Answer before; shewing you how this case is dangerous, yet not desperate. To which let me add a word more. Such relapses into gross and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous sins, are not ordinarily to be found in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons truly Regenerate. <hi>David</hi> committed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery</hi> but once; and <hi>Peter,</hi> though he denied his Master thrice, yet it was at one and the same time, whilst he was under the same Temptation. His falling being like that of a man falling down a pair of stairs, who falls three steps one after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother before he can recover himself; all which is but one fall. As for gross sins in a sanctified
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:192573:60"/>person, they are like some diseases in the Body, (as the <hi>Quartan Ague</hi>) which being once per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cured, seldome return again. But suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing this to be thy case, yet despair not, hearing God to say this unto thee; <hi>My grace is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for thee.</hi> Provided that there be the like <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> in thee as was in <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and then doubt not of finding the like <hi>grace</hi> exercised upon thee as was upon them. He that requireth it of thee, that <hi>If thy Brother trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again unto thee, saying I repent, thou shalt forgive him;</hi> (which our Saviour doth, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.3.) will not be wanting in the exercise of the like grace towards thee, as in pardoning, so in healing thy reiterated transgressions. Only see that thy repentance be true and sincere. And then remember the <hi>Caveat</hi> which I gave before; Take heed of abusing this Grace, by making it an occasion of sin: But (as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our said to the impotent man, whom he had cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of a long continued infirmity, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.14.) <hi>Go thy way and sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.</hi>

<note place="margin">Comfort in Temptations.</note> of what kind soever it be, yet give not way to despon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency; but still remember this <hi>Consolation,</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God say unto us, what here he doth to his servant <hi>Paul</hi> in the like condition; <hi>My grace is sufficient for thee.</hi> Which make we use of in the midst of these Conflicts, for the supporting and bearing up our spirits in wrastling with these
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:192573:61"/>Temptations, whatever they be; whether <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> or <hi>Inward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For <hi>Outward Temptations,</hi> such as we meet withal in and from the <hi>world,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Outward; whether De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terring.</note> be they <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terring</hi> or <hi>Alluring,</hi> yet fear them not: I mean with a distrustfull, distractfull fear. Fear them we may, nay we ought, specially the latter of these, which are of the two the most dangerous; <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is the man that feareth alwayes</hi> (saith the <hi>Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>) Prov. 28.14. that fearing <hi>God</hi> with a fear of Reverence; feareth <hi>himself</hi> being conscious of his own weakness, and so feareth all his <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Enemies,</hi> lest he should be overcome or hurt by them. Thus a Christian may and ought (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other) to fear the <hi>world,</hi> to be afraid of the <hi>Temptations</hi> of it: But not with a diffident, distrustfull and distractfull fear. Thus fear not <hi>Deterring Temptations.</hi> Of these we must make account to meet with many, much opposition from the men of the world. <hi>Because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you,</hi> (saith our Saviour to his Disciples) <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.5.19. So it is, there being an <hi>Antipathy</hi> betwixt these two <hi>spirits,</hi> that which is in the world, and that which is in those that are called out of it, the Spirit of <hi>God,</hi> which is a <hi>holy</hi> Spirit, and the Spirit of <hi>Satan,</hi> which is a <hi>wicked</hi> spirit; those in whom this <hi>wicked spirit</hi> dwelleth and ruleth, (as it doth in the men of the world, wicked and ungodly men) they do naturally hate those in whom the <hi>spirit of God</hi> dwelleth and worketh, being visible in the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it. And hating them, they will be ready
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:192573:61"/>as occasion is to express their hatred, both by word and deed, being unto them <hi>as thorns in their flesh,</hi> as the <hi>messengers of Satan to buffet them,</hi> so seeking to stop or hinder them in their course; discouraging and disheartning them what they can. But let not Gods servants give way to those Temptations. Be we not terrified by them. <hi>Only let our Conversation be such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the Gospel of Christ:</hi> And then (as <hi>Paul</hi> encourageth his <hi>Phillippians,</hi> cap. 1. v. 27, 28.) <hi>In nothing be terrified by these our Adversaries, Fear not their fear, neither be afraid,</hi> (as the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> hath it) <hi>Isa.</hi> 8.12. But bear up head and heart against all their menaces; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the grace of God is sufficient to support and bear up our spirits under these discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to carry us on in our course. Even as we see how a good gale of <hi>wind</hi> carrieth a small Vessel at Sea against the strongest <hi>tide,</hi> so as it not only beareth up head against it, but maketh way through it; so is the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> (which is compared to a <hi>wind,</hi> as you heard <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8.) able to bear up our Spirits against whatever op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position we may meet withall in and from the world.</p>
               <p>And so it is to keep us from the <hi>Allurements</hi> of it;
<note place="margin">Or Alluring.</note> which (as I said) are more dangerous then the former. Yet this is the <hi>sufficiency of this Grace,</hi> that it is able to keep us in the midst of these <hi>Temptations</hi> so as we shall not be ensnared by them; not so taken with the <hi>Profits, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, Honours</hi> of the world, as to have our hearts inordinately set upon them. Of this
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:192573:62"/>
                  <hi>sufficiency</hi> others of the Saints of God have had a gracious experience. So had <hi>Moses,</hi> who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in <hi>Pharaohs Court</hi> yet was not taken with what he there saw. Not with the <hi>Honours</hi> and <hi>Promotions</hi> which were tendred to him. <hi>When he was come to years,</hi> (years of discretion, so as he was capable of preferment) <hi>he refused to be called the son of Pharaohs daughter,</hi> Heb. 11.24. To be her <hi>adopted Son;</hi> the highest promotion that that Kingdom could afford, and a fair step to the Crown, which very probably in that way he might have obtained; yet he slighted the offer. And so for the <hi>Pleasures</hi> which he might there have enjoyed, he slighted them. <hi>Chusing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleasures of sin</hi> (or <hi>sinfull plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi>) <hi>for a season,</hi> (so it followeth) <hi>v.</hi> 25. And the like for the <hi>Profits,</hi> (as the next verse hath it) <hi>Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches then the treasures of Egypt,</hi> v. 26. Thus was he weaned from the world, not being taken with any of these Temptations. And how came he so to be? Not out of a <hi>stoïcal Apathy,</hi> or <hi>Antipathy,</hi> any natural dislike that he had of these things, but from a <hi>supernatural Principle,</hi> the work of <hi>grace</hi> in him; <hi>By faith Moses,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>v.</hi> 24. And the like work the same <hi>grace</hi> of God had in and upon this our Apostle, who tells his <hi>Galathians</hi> what little affection he had to the world, or any thing in it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. <hi>The world is crucified to me, and I unto the world.</hi> The <hi>Profits, Pleasures, Honours</hi> of the world, which the men of the world so much dote upon; they
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:192573:62"/>were no more to him then a dead thing, then a crucified Body is to the Spectators, which dying so ignominious a death is scorned by them (as our Saviour was by the Jewes) neither could they any more move or stir him, then sensual objects can move or affect a dying man. And how came <hi>Paul</hi> to be thus disaffected to the world? Why, it was onely by the power of Christ working in him, as he there sets it forth; <hi>By whom the world is crucified to me,</hi> &amp;c. Having a spiritual union and communion with Christ, he had this vertue derived from him, whereby he became thus mortified in his affections. Now what this grace of God hath done for them, and many others, it is able to do the like for us. Having called us out of the world it is able to keep us in it, inabling us so to resist the Temptations of it, as that we shall not be overcome by them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as for <hi>Outward,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Inward Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations.</note> so for <hi>Inward</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations. Is it so, that we are exercised with these Conflicts in our Souls,

As this is no other then what the dearest Saints of God (some of them) have had experience of, so that grace which hath supported them, is able to do the like for us. This (as you have heard) is conceived to have been <hi>Pauls</hi> case here. He was thus <hi>buffetted;</hi> yet the Lord willeth him to rest contented, giving him to know that his <hi>grace was sufficient</hi> for him. And so it is for us, suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to support and strengthen us in this Combate,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:192573:63"/>and in the end to give us the victory over this our grand Enemy. <hi>The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly,</hi> Rom. 16.20.</p>

As he is said to have done against his people <hi>Israel,</hi> Isa. 63.8, 9, 10. Having owned them for his people, and being a tender and compassionate Saviour to them, sympathizing with them, <hi>In all their afflictions he was afflicted, and the Angel of his presence saved them; In his love and in his pity he redeemed them, and he bare them, and carried them all the dayes of old,</hi> v. 9. Such had his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection been to them. But they being changed, so was he; They <hi>rebelling,</hi> and <hi>vexing his holy Spirit, He was turned to be their Enemy, and he fought against them,</hi> v. 10. Even so fareth it with me. Time was when I had gracious experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Gods love and favour to me, when his face shone upon me, and I walked in the light of his countenance, but I having offended and provoked him by my sins, he hath now turned away his face from me; nay he is turned to be mine Enemy, fighting against me, as by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward judgments, so by inward horrors and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, wherewith my soul is filled.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Of all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts this the forest.</note> A sad condition; yet despair not. Of all <hi>Conflicts</hi> none like unto this, yet faint not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it; but still hear thy God saying unto thee, <hi>My grace is sufficient for thee.</hi> So it was for his servant <hi>Job,</hi> whom we may hear passionately
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:192573:63"/>complaining to his friends, Job. 6.4. <hi>The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of the Almighty are within me, the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whereof drinketh up my Spirit; The terrours of God do set themselves in array against me, &amp;c.</hi> God did not onely visit and afflict him <hi>outwardly,</hi> in his estate, his children, his body, but <hi>inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> in his soul, filling it with horrors and terrors, yet was Gods grace sufficient for him, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port him in this conflict, and to give him a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable issue out of it. <hi>Ye have heard of the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Job</hi> (saith St. <hi>James</hi>) <hi>and have seen the end of the Lord</hi> (what end he made with him,) <hi>that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy,</hi> Jam. 5.11. So the Lord was to him; however he <hi>wrote bitter things against him</hi> (as elswhere he complaineth, Job 13.26.) <hi>making him to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess the iniquities of his youth;</hi> bringing his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer sins committed in his age of ignorance and imprudence to his remembrance, setting them in order before him to his great horror and terror, yet he was to him <hi>very pitiful and of tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>

Thus then though there may be nothing but frownes without, yet still there are Bowels of Compassion within towards all those who are Gods children by Adoption and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:192573:64"/>Grace. So the Lord himself tells his <hi>Israel,</hi> Isa. 31.20. <hi>Is Ephraim my dear Son, is he a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant child? For since I spake against him, I do earnestly remember him still; Therefore my bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els are troubled for him, I will surely have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon him, saith the Lord.</hi> Such Bowels of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pity and compassion hath the God of all grace towards all his adopted children, such as are <hi>under grace;</hi> which in due time will break forth in the exercise of his grace and mercy upon them. In the mean time whilest he thinketh fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to hold them under this saddest conflict, his grace is sufficient to uphold them, yea so to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to wrastle with him (as <hi>Jacob</hi> did) that they may prevail with him.</p>
               <p>Thus then you see how useful this <hi>Soveraigne Cordial</hi> may be, and in its self is, for the bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of drooping spirits under whatever <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,</hi> whether <hi>Outward,</hi> or <hi>Inward.</hi> Which use let all that can make this out, that they are (as I said) <hi>under grace,</hi> make of it.</p>

Let this be granted, yet the <hi>grace of God is sufficient for thee,</hi> to make a supply to this thy want. <hi>He that hath begun the good work</hi> in thee <hi>is able to perfect it;</hi> to give thee such a portion of grace as shall be <hi>requisite</hi> or <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient</hi> for thee. Requisite for thy <hi>Salvation,</hi> and expedient for thy <hi>condition.</hi> It was the case of that poor <hi>widdow of Zaraphath</hi> (or <hi>Sarepta</hi>) of whom we read, 1 King. 17. She had but a <hi>handful of meal, and a little oyl in a cruise,</hi> to maintain her self and her Son. But what saith the <hi>Prophet</hi> to her when she made this complaint to him? You may read it, v. 13. <hi>And Eliah said unto her, Fear not, &amp;c. For thus saith the Lord God of Israel, the barrel of meal shall not waste, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall the cruise of oil fail, until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth.</hi> Which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly came to pass, as the verses following set it forth, v. 15, 16. Thus did that little by a special providence afford sufficient food for her and hers. And doubt not but the grace of God is able to do the like for thee. Onely do thou as she did; imploy that little stock of <hi>grace</hi> which thou hast for <hi>God,</hi> as she did her <hi>handful of meal</hi> in making a <hi>Cake for Eliah.</hi> And then doubt not but he both can and will make the like supply to thee. <hi>His grace is sufficient</hi> for thee to make
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:192573:66"/>thee grow and increase in grace. We see what a <hi>general providence</hi> doth for <hi>Herbs</hi> and <hi>Plants,</hi> making them to grow up, some of them from a small seed to a tall tree. So our Saviour obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it of the <hi>grain of Mustard seed,</hi> Matth. 13.31. how that <hi>being the least of all seeds</hi> (one of the least) yet <hi>it groweth up to be the greatest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong herbs, and becometh a tree, so as the birds of the aire come and lodge in the Branches thereof,</hi> (so it seemeth it did in that Country of <hi>Palestine,</hi> growing higher and larger there then elsewhere.) And is not the <hi>special grace</hi> of God able to do the like for his Elect people? Having sown the seed of his sanctifying grace in their hearts, though it be at the first but like that <hi>grain,</hi> very small and inconsiderable; yet he is able to make it grow and increase until it come to perfection. And let all who are <hi>under grace</hi> (still I strike upon that string, as being that which every one who would lay hold of the Comfort here held forth, must labour to get some clear and comfortable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of) be comfortably assured, that whilest they wait upon him in the use of means, he will do for them. They being <hi>like trees planted by the rivers of water</hi> (as the Psalmist compareth the godly man, Psal. 1.3.) being watered by the continual influences of divine grace, they shall grow and flourish. Onely (as I hinted it before, and shall touch upon it again hereafter) be not wanting in the use of means, nor in the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that little which thou hast. We see how by an ordinary Providence <hi>good Husbands</hi> beginning with a small stock grow up to great estates. And
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:192573:66"/>by the same means may a poor soul come (through the blessing of God, the concurrence of his grace with its endeavours) to increase in his spiritual estate, so as to grow rich in grace. <hi>I know thy works and thy tribulations, and poverty, but thou art rich</hi> (saith the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> to the Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi>) Rev. 2.9. And this it may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably hope and look for, having Christs own promise for it; <hi>Unto every one that hath, shall be given, and he shall have abundance,</hi> Matth. 25.29. That good and faithful servant, who by his diligence had doubled his <hi>Talents,</hi> by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with them, of <hi>five</hi> making them <hi>ten,</hi> he had another <hi>Talent</hi> given him, which was taken from him who had <hi>hid it in a napkin</hi> (as we there find it in the verse fore-going.) Thus whilest Christians indeavour what they can to make im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of that grace which they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, let them not doubt of having a gracious supply made to them, so as they shall <hi>increase with the increase of God,</hi> until they <hi>come to be perfect men in Christ Jesus.</hi>

               <p>Thus then you see how <hi>Soveraign a Cordial</hi> this is, how this <hi>Sufficiency of divine grace</hi> may serve to meet with all Objections that a <hi>drooping spirit</hi> may make, and so to bear it up under the saddest and sorest Conflicts.</p>

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:192573:72"/>Joh. 11.) he fals sick, dies, is buried, lieth four dayes in the grave.

Or when he was buried, could not he have raised him up again before the fourth day? but suffer him to lie so long in the grave, til (as <hi>Martha</hi> concluded) his case was now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate, and past all hope. Lord (saith she) by <hi>this time he stinketh, for he hath been dead four dayes,</hi> v. 39. Now wherefore was all this? why it was not without a <hi>Reason.</hi> So our Saviour himself telleth the Messengers who brought him the first tidings of his sickness, v. 4. <hi>This sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> (saith he) <hi>is not unto death,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> irrepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and irrevocably, so as that he should be held under the power of it) <hi>but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.</hi> And the like he saith to <hi>Martha,</hi> being at the grave with him, v. 40. <hi>Jesus saith unto her, said I not unto thee, that if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldst see the glory of God.</hi> See the glory of his power manifested in his Resurrection. Thus hath God in these Dispensations an eye both at his <hi>People,</hi> and at <hi>Himself.</hi> And upon this double account it was that the Lord here permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his servant <hi>Paul</hi> to be thus <hi>buffeted by the Messenger of Satan,</hi> as he was, and that not for a brunt, a short skirmish, but continuing him under the Combate, notwithstanding his frequent and earnest solicitations for a discharge.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:192573:72"/>This was done, as for <hi>Pauls good,</hi> his Spiritual profit and benefit, in preventing a great evil, which he was in danger of, so for the <hi>glory of God,</hi> as the glory of his <hi>grace,</hi> so of his <hi>power,</hi> both which by this means should be more clearly manifested in the supporting of him in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, and bringing him off a Conquerour in the end.

<note place="margin">Vertue is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; and how.</note> by or through weakness and infirmity.

Thus <hi>Temptations</hi> become a means for the confirming and strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of faith, which is exercised thereby. Even as the shaking of the tree is a means for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rooting of it, not in it self, but occasionally; so is faith confirmed by Temptation, by causing the soul being shaken, to take the faster hold of Christ. Thus doth the wisdome and goodnesse of God bring good out of evil, making things in themselves hurtful to become advantageous unto his people. Upon which account it is that he lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them to be exercised therewith. Upon such account it was (as <hi>Aquinas</hi> notes it writing
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:192573:74"/>upon the Text) that God would not have all the <hi>Heathen Nations</hi> to be destroyed and rooted out, but left a remnant of them, which were as <hi>wasps</hi> to the Israelites <hi>hive;</hi> continually infesting of them, and making incursions upon them. This he did with an eye to his people, for their good, to <hi>prove</hi> them and to <hi>teach</hi> them; Both which we find given as Reasons hereof, Judg. 3. To <hi>prove</hi> them; <hi>These are the Nations which the Lord left to prove Israel by them,</hi> v. 1. that he might thereby try them whether they would be constant in their faith and obedience; cleaving close unto him in the Profession and Practice of his pure Religion. To <hi>teach</hi> them, <hi>viz.</hi> the Art of <hi>Martial Discipline.</hi> So it followeth in the next verse, <hi>That the generations of the children of Israel might know to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof,</hi> v. 2. That being continually exercised by these their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, they might themselves grow expert in Military affairs, so as to teach their Posterity, that so they might not in aftertimes become a prey to them or any other. Which policy (as he also notes) was afterwards made use of by <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio,</hi> who would not yield that the City of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> should be destroyed, that so the <hi>Romans</hi> having a forreign enemy to wage war with, they might not be infested with what was far worse, a <hi>Civil War</hi> amongst themselves. And thus God suffers his people to be exercised with <hi>Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and trials from abroad, to be assaulted by <hi>Satan</hi> and his <hi>Instruments,</hi> that so by that means inward <hi>Corruption</hi> may be weakened, and the

<note place="margin">A truth, Gods people are oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times great gainers by Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</note> Gods people are gainers, and oft-times great gainers by their afflictions and sufferings. <hi>Whilest the outward man perisheth, the inward man is renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed day by day</hi> (as the Apostle telleth us) 2 Cor. 4.16. whilest the Body is weakned by sickness, or other sufferings, the soul getteth strength, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing in grace and vertue. This both <hi>Divines</hi> and <hi>Moralists</hi> have taken notice of, who have looked upon afflictions as the School of vertue. <hi>Calamitas saepius disciplina virtutis est</hi> (saith <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius Faelix.</hi>) Calamity is often the discipline of vertue. Whereby men are often much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. <hi>Optimos nos esse dum infirmi sumus</hi> (so said <hi>Pliny,</hi> cited by <hi>Grotius</hi> upon the Text, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the former Author,) Men are then best, when they are weakest. And this Gods people have usually had comfortable experience of. So had <hi>David,</hi> who (as he declareth it) found great spiritual benefit by his afflictions. <hi>It is good for me</hi> (saith he) <hi>that I have been afflicted, that I might learn thy statutes,</hi> Psal. 119.71. <hi>Before I was afflicted, I went astray, but now have I kept thy word,</hi> v. 67. And so have many others, who have had cause to confesse that they have been more beholding to God for some one Affliction, then for all the temporal mercies that ever he bestowed upon them.

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:192573:82"/>more then in others, in <hi>weak Christians;</hi> In whom there is weakness of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> or of <hi>Faith.</hi> Of the former of which the Apostle speaketh, Rom. 14.1. <hi>Him that is weak in the faith receive you, &amp;c.</hi> viz. the weak brother, who is weak in knowledge, not being so perfectly, so through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly instructed in the doctrine of the Gospel, as others are, and he ought to be. And so again, Rom. 6.19. where he tells his <hi>Romans</hi> that the Reason why he spake to him after that manner that he did, <hi>After the manner of men,</hi> expressing and setting forth to them sublime spiritual Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by vulgar similitudes, which it may be did not so fully suit with the matter intended, was <hi>the Infirmity of their flesh,</hi> that is, the weaknesse and dullnesse of their understandings, which being a relict of the <hi>flesh,</hi> a remainder of sinful Corruption, makes spiritual things hard to be apprehended in their own natural sense, so as to make a right use of them. Of the latter speaketh the <hi>Psalmist, David,</hi> or <hi>Asaph,</hi> Psal. 77.10. <hi>And I said this is my infirmity,</hi> confessing and acknowledging the weaknesse of his faith and confidence in God. And such weaknesse the best of Saints have experience of, being through the weaknesse of grace, unable of themselves to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist Temptation,</hi> to <hi>subdue Corruption,</hi> to <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Duties, to endure Sufferings,</hi> of which I spake before.</p>
               <p>These are the <hi>Infirmities</hi> which Gods Elect people are subject to,

<note place="margin">Supporting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme Bodies.</note> and sometimes making use of them as very serviceable Instruments, in doing great service to God and his Church, which was <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moehies</hi> case; who though of an infirme consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutiou, yet was an eminent labourer in the

<note place="margin">Restoring them from dangeroussick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</note> And sometimes in <hi>resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> and raising them up from dangerous, and (in their own and others apprehensions) desperate diseases; when they are at the brink of the pit, the mouth of the grave, ready to be swallowed up, then working unexpected deliverances for them. Such Providences the sons of men have frequent experience of. Which we have set forth by <hi>Elihu</hi> in <hi>Job,</hi> cap. 33. Where speaking of Gods making use of <hi>sicknesse</hi> (among other affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions) as a means to bring men home to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he sheweth how upon their repenting and seeking unto him, he then manifests his power in their weaknesse. <hi>When his soul draweth near unto the grave,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Then is he gracious unto him, and shall deliver him from going down into the pit,</hi> v. 22.24. <hi>Lo all these things worketh God oftentimes with man, to bring back his soul from the pit,</hi> v. 29, 30. Here is Gods power exercised and manifested. So was the power of <hi>Christ</hi> in healing all manner of diseases, curing the blind, and the lame, and the sick in a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous way. And so is the power of God often in his ordinary providences of this kind. Hereof our Apostle had experience in himself, as he tels his <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.8, 9. where speaking of some <hi>great trouble</hi> which happened to him in <hi>Asia,</hi> (probably conceived to have been some dangerous sicknesse) he sheweth how it lay so heavy upon him, that he was (as he saith) <hi>pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed out of measure above strength,</hi> in so much that he even <hi>despaired of life,</hi> having had <hi>the sentence of death in himself.</hi> Thus was he brought low,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:192573:84"/>being past hope, as in the judgement of others, so of himself. But now in this desperate conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord was pleased to step in unto him, shewing his power in his weaknesse, <hi>delivering him from so grent a death</hi> (as it followeth v. 10.) Like experience many others have had, and daily have, in whose <hi>Bodily weaknesse</hi> Gods <hi>strength</hi> is <hi>made perfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which also it is in extricating and delivering them from other eminent <hi>dangers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Delivering them from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eminent dangers.</note> saving and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them out of the hands of their <hi>enemies,</hi> which were too strong for them. Hereof <hi>David</hi> had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent experience, who tells us how the Lord <hi>brought him up out of a horrible pit,</hi> Psal. 40.2. and how he <hi>delivered his soul from death,</hi> Psal. 56.13. working for him great and wonderful deliverances. And the like had <hi>Paul,</hi> who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints <hi>Timothy</hi> how when he was brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Nero,</hi> and was in great danger of his life, all his friends forsook him; But (saith he) <hi>The Lord stood with me, and strengthened me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And I was delivered out of the mouth of the Lion,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.17. Now here is the strength of God perfected in weaknesse, in working these tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral salvations for his people, when they can do nothing for themselves. This he did for his servant <hi>David,</hi> who setting forth the great things which his God had done for him, Psal. 18. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst many other things tells us, v. 16, 17. <hi>He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters. He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me, for they were too strong for me.</hi> And the like he had done
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:192573:85"/>before for his people <hi>Israel,</hi> in bringing them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> carrying them through the Red Sea, and through the Wildernesse, where he wrought many temporal salvations for them: All which he did for the manifestation of his own power, which was perfected in their weaknesse. <hi>Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse he saved them for his Names sake; that he might make his mighty power to be known,</hi> Psal. 106.8. which in and by these deliverances it was. <hi>Thy right hand, O Lord, is become glorious in power</hi> (saith <hi>Moses</hi> in his song, made and sung by him and the people upon that great and wonderful deliverance which God had wrought for them, in bringing them through the Red Sea, where their enemies, the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> pursuing them, were drowned) Exod. 15.6.</p>
               <p>To these we may add those other <hi>temporal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities</hi> which Gods people here are subject to,
<note place="margin">Supporting them in their sufferings.</note> and that more then others, their sufferings in their <hi>estates, good names, Liberties,</hi> by <hi>Crosses,</hi> and <hi>Losses, Reproaches, Restraints,</hi> &amp;c. Here also is the strength of God perfected in their weaknesse, in supporting and delivering them; bearing up their spirits under them, and giving them a comfortable issue out of them. All which this our Apostle had great and gracious experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of; who tells us (as you have before heard) in the verse after the Text, that when he was <hi>weak,</hi> then was he <hi>strong▪</hi> The more he was outwardly pressed with those <hi>Infirmities</hi> which he there speaketh of, <hi>Reproaches, Necessities, Persecutions, Distresses,</hi> he was the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly strong, strong in spirit, and the more
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:192573:85"/>inabled to do service to God and his Church: Thus is divine strength made perfect in the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the <hi>Outward Man.</hi>
               </p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> which (as you have heard) are sometimes dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, as falls are to the Bodies of men,
<note place="margin">In Actual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they become lame, or weak (as <hi>Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth</hi> was by his fall from his nurses arms.) Such are <hi>scandalous sins,</hi> which Gods own Children, through the infirmity of the flesh, sometimes fall into. Hereby it may be the soul is for the present much weakned, being (as it were) put out of joint, so as they walk heavily and lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But herein is divine strength made perfect,
<note place="margin">Raising them up, being fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len.</note> in restoring and raising them up again from these falls, restoring them to former strength and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, strengthening and inabling them to go on in their former course as vigorously, if not more vigorously then before. An instance whereof we have in <hi>Peter,</hi> who having denied his Lord and Master thrice, yet afterwards was so strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he confessed him unto the death, which he suffered for him, so <hi>glorifying God by his death,</hi> as his Master had fore-told him that he should do, Joh. 20.19. Here is <hi>divine strength made perfect in humane weakness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. And so it is when Christians,

The like cure is God pleased to work upon poor <hi>impotent souls,</hi> inabling them by the power of his Spirit to <hi>rise</hi> and <hi>walk;</hi> by his strength carrying them on in the course of their <hi>Active and Passive obedience,</hi> strengthening them to that four-fold Act before spoken of, to <hi>Resist Temptations,</hi> to <hi>Subdue Corruption,</hi> to <hi>performe duties,</hi> to <hi>endure sufferings.</hi> Here also is divine strength made perfect in humane weaknesse.

               <p>Thus I have done with the second of these senses, which the words in the Text do properly bear; shewing you how Gods strength is said to be made perfect in <hi>weaknesse it self,</hi> which is a Proper object for it to work upon; <hi>Ubi mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam habet se exercendi</hi> (as <hi>Calvin</hi> explains it) where it findeth fit <hi>matter</hi> to put forth and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise it self upon, and to manifest it self by.

And being thus sensible of it, now they are brought to a free <hi>acknowledgement</hi> of it, so as to give unto God the praise and glory of it. So was it with <hi>Job,</hi> who having had such expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of his own <hi>weakness</hi> in those many and great conflicts wherewith he had been exercised, and withal of Gods <hi>power</hi> in supporting of him in them, and giving him so comfortable an issue out of them, by this means he came to have a more clear and full knowledge of God, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he had before. <hi>I have heard of thee</hi> (saith he) <hi>by the hearing of the ears, but now mine eye seeth thee,</hi> Job 42.5. He had before heard o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers speak highly of God, of his infinite wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and power, but now having had such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of it in himself, in his own weaknesse, he came to see what before he had onely heard of, to be more sensible of it, then ever before; whereupon he was ready to confesse and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it. Which he doth v. 2. <hi>I know</hi> (saith he,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:192573:87"/>speaking unto God) <hi>that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be with-holden from thee;</hi> (as if he had said, I do now, having had such sensible experience of thy power as I have had, acknowledge that there is nothing which thou art not able to do, and that as thy counsels are wise and just, so thou wantest not power to bring to passe whatever thou hast decreed and determined to do. Thus was Gods strength made perfect in his weaknesse, being by this means more clearly and fully made known to him. And upon the like account it was that the Lord here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with his servant <hi>Paul</hi> after that manner that he did, suffering him still to lie and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue under that sad conflict, wherewith he was exercised; this he did to the end that he having had such experience of his own weaknesse, might be the more apprehensive and sensible of the power of God in supporting and delivering him, so as to acknowledge it, and give him the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it. Thus, as in <hi>weaknesse it self</hi> the power of God is manifested unto <hi>others,</hi> who behold it, so in the <hi>sense of weaknesse</hi> it is manifested to a <hi>mans self,</hi> and so becometh the more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in his eye. Even as when the Sun breaketh forth of a thick cloud, or the light shineth in a dark place (as that did in the <hi>Prison</hi> where <hi>Peter</hi> was, Acts 12.7.) the eye of the beholder is hereby so much the more affected with it.

<note place="margin">Directed, first, in a General way, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Church.</note> are Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, as occasion is offered, to speak a word of Comfort. <hi>Speak comfortably to Hierusalem,</hi> (saith the Lord to his Prophets,) Isa. 40.1. And this let me do at present. So it is, the Church, being here in a militant state, is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to many Conflicts. In which, having ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and potent enemies, it may be brought to a weak and low condition. So it was in the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> and <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity; In which latter the people of the <hi>Jewes</hi> were but like those <hi>dry bones,</hi> which the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> saw in his Vision, Ezek. 37.1, 2. An <hi>Emblem</hi> very fitly representing and setting forth the deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable state of the Church at that time, as we have it afterwards interpreted and applyed, v. 11. <hi>And he said unto me, Son of man these bones are the whole house of Israel: Behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost, we are cut off for our parts.</hi> And so was it afterwards under the heathen <hi>Roman Emperours;</hi> Where <hi>the great red Dragon stood before the woman, to devour her
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:192573:88"/>child assoon as it was born,</hi> Rev. 12.4. Satan, making use of those cruel and bloody Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, opposed the Church of Christ, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring utterly to destroy and root it off from the earth, not sparing any that made a professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the name of Christ. And so hath it since been, and at this day is, under their Successors, the <hi>Romish Antichrist;</hi> Under whose Tyranny we read how the <hi>two witnesses</hi> were slain, Rev. 11.7, 8. <hi>The beast that ascendeth out of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomlesse pit shall make warre against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them; And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great City,</hi> &amp;c. Such havock hath this <hi>Beast</hi> (so called for his savage cruelty) made of the faithful servants of God, who have in their generations given testimony to his truth, and in special of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi> of Christ, who are his <hi>witnesses</hi> after a special manner, as Christ saith his Apostles should be, Acts 1.8; exercising all kind of cruelty upon them. And this towards the end of his reign he shall do more then ever; that being the <hi>Devils mode,</hi> as we have it set forth, Rev. 12.12. <hi>For the Devil is come down unto you, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.</hi> Such is the Churches condition, sometimes very weak and low. But let not this discourage and dishearten those that, being true Members of this Body, do sympathize with it, and wish well to it, praying for the peace and prosperity of it. Though <hi>Jerusalems</hi> strength be small, yet she hath a <hi>strong God</hi> to protect her, who will make his strength perfect in her weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:192573:88"/>And therefore fear not. So we may hear the Lord animating and encouraging his people, the people of the <hi>Jewes</hi> in their <hi>Babylonish Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,</hi> Isa. 41. when they were in a low condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not able to do any thing for themselves, having little hope of ever seeing <hi>Jerusalem</hi> again, of ever being restored to their former state; yet now he bids them not fear: <hi>Fear thou not</hi> (saith he, v. 10.) <hi>for I am with thee; Be not dismayed, for I am thy God, I will strengthen thee; yea I will help thee; yea I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousnesse.</hi> And again, v. 14, 15. <hi>Fear not thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel, I will help, saith the Lord, and thy Redeemer, the holy One of Israel; Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth; thou shalt thresh the Mountains, and beat them small, and shalt make the hills as chaffe.</hi> Such was the Churches condition then, she was but a <hi>worm,</hi> trodden upon by every foot, very contemptible and despicable in the eyes of the World; yet the Lord willeth her not to fear, in as much as he, being her Guardian, vvould so assist and strengthen her, as that she should be able, not onely to vvithstand, but to conquer and subdue all her enemies, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so many, never so mighty. Such a Restau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration the Lord maketh promise of unto them; he vvould raise them out of that lovv estate. Those dead and dry bones should live again. So he vvilleth his Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to prophesie over them, Ezek. 37.4. <hi>Say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord: Thus saith the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:192573:89"/>Lord God unto these bones, Behold I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live. And I will lay sinewes upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you,</hi> &amp;c. God vvould have his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple knovv, and be assured of it, that by his povver, his strength put forth in their vveak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, they should be restored to, and established in their former estate. This he promised, and accordingly performed unto them. And the like he hath done and will do to his <hi>Church</hi> under the <hi>Gospel,</hi> to which that afore said Prophesie of the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> is by the generality of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors conceived to have an eye; as divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of his Prophesies clearly have, which set forth the flourishing state of the Church under the Gospel. So doth that known one, Isa. 2.2. <hi>And it shall come to passe</hi> (saith he) <hi>in the last dayes, that the mountain of the Lords house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all Nations shall flow unto it.</hi> Which cannot well be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the Church under the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> which consisted onely of one Nation, the <hi>Jewes,</hi> but of that under the <hi>New,</hi> where <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> shall meet together for the compleating of it, and making it a full and a glorious Body; which it shall be, being in regard of the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al glory of it advanced above all the Kingdoms of the world. Many other <hi>Prophesies</hi> of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we meet withal in that, and other of the Prophets, wherein God hath promised to do great and wonderful things for his Church in the latter dayes. Now having such <hi>Promises,</hi> let
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:192573:89"/>not the present state of it, how weak and mean so ever it be, be any discouragement to any that wish well to it. That God who hath made these promises, being a <hi>God of power,</hi> is able to performe them. It matters not though the eye of <hi>Reason</hi> cannot discern how, in what way, and by what means this work should be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or by what Instruments so great a mercy shall be conveyed. It is enough for <hi>faith</hi> to rest upon, what the Lord here saith, <hi>My strength is made perfect in weaknesse.</hi> Humane weaknesse is no obstruction to divine strength. That God to whom belongeth wisdome and power, can ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and bring to passe great things by weak means, if not without them, (as before you have heard.) That <hi>stone</hi> which <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> in his dream saw <hi>cut out of the mountain without hands,</hi> is said to have <hi>smote the Image, and to become a great mountain, and to have filled the whole earth,</hi> Dan 2.35. The Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> who was conceived and born of a <hi>Virgin,</hi> not by the way of natural generation, as all others have been and are, but by the <hi>over-shadowing of the Holy Ghost,</hi> the immediate power of God, in his entrance into, and continuance in the world, he vvas mean and despicable, but novv he is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to be <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> the Universal Monarch of the World. And as it vvas, and is vvith his <hi>Person,</hi> so shall it be vvith his <hi>Kingdome,</hi> his <hi>Church,</hi> vvhich though but a <hi>little stone,</hi> small in the beginning of it, shall yet <hi>smite the Image, the Image of the Beast,</hi> Antichrist, with his adherents, breaking in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

               <p>And therefore let none now <hi>despise the day of small things.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Day of small things not to be despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</note> With this the Lord upbraids some of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> who when the foundation of the Temple was laid by <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> they seeing such weak Instruments set a work, and the work go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on so slowly, they feared that those poor and small beginnings would have no good end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but that the design would come to naught, he reproveth them for giving way to such doubts and fears, Zach. 4.10. <hi>For</hi> (saith he) <hi>who hath despised the day of small things? For they shall rejoyce, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel.</hi> Notwithstanding all their disdain and diffidence, they should see vvhat they looked not for, and have cause to rejoyce, when they should see the work carried on to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:192573:90"/>laid the foundation of this house, his hands also shall finish it.</hi> Thus did the Lord begin and carry on that <hi>Temple work,</hi> not by any humane power, or policy; but by his own strength. So he told <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> that he would do, v. 6. <hi>Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.</hi> And what the Lord there fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told him touching the <hi>material Temple,</hi> shall be made good in the building of the <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Temple,</hi> the Church (of which the Temple was a Type.) This work being put into the hands of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> (of whom also <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> was a Type) it shall be carried on in the like way. Not as wordly <hi>Empires</hi> are, which for the most part are got and kept by force of Armes; but <hi>by the Spirit of the Lord;</hi> by his strength made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in weaknesse. Which (as our <hi>Annotator</hi> writing upon the tenth verse of that Chapter, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth use of it) is the singular comfort of the Church in all ages, and at this very day.</p>
               <p>And as it speaketh comfort to the Church in general,

This Gods children sometimes are not, not so sensible here of as they ought to be.

By this means he preventeth or cureth that spiritual <hi>Tympany</hi> of the Soul, which the best of Saints are subject to; <hi>hiding Pride from them.</hi> This <hi>Elihu</hi> tells <hi>Job</hi> that God doth sometimes by <hi>dreams</hi> and <hi>visions,</hi> revealing to a man his own vileness. <hi>Then</hi> (saith he) <hi>he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction; that he may with-draw man from his purposes, and hide pride from man;</hi> Job 33.17. that is, keep him from doing the evil which he intended, and from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inordinately lifted up in himself, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably <hi>Elihu</hi> apprehended his friend <hi>Job</hi> to be guilty of, or subject to.

Upon this account it was (as you have heard) that the Lord proceeded with his servant <hi>Paul</hi> after this manner that he did, letting Satan loose upon him to <hi>buffet</hi> him, and continuing him under that Conflict, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his frequent and earnest solicitations for a release; This he did, that he might <hi>hide pride</hi> from him, keep him from that spiritual pride which he was in danger of, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>exalted above measure, through that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance

Now then, for the preventing of these and the like trials, labour we to be truly and throughly sensible of our own weaknesse. Our <hi>spiritual weaknesse</hi> (I mean). As for other weaknesses, the weaknesses of the outward man, weaknesse of body, or weaknesse of estate, &amp;c. these <hi>Temporal Infirmities</hi> we are sensible enough of (and oft-times too much.)

How that we are <hi>not sufficient of our selves to think any thing as of our selves</hi> (which the Apostle tells us the best of Saints are not, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5.) How subject of our selves we are every moment, not onely to <hi>slip,</hi> but to <hi>fall;</hi> and that not onely into particular sins, but to fall away <hi>Totally</hi> and <hi>Finally</hi> from the grace of God.

And this let the Lords people do in the like cases. Which yet let it be warily and rightly understood. Not but that they may and ought to make use of lawful and warrantable wayes and means for their security, where God offers them to them. But not of such as are unlawful, unwarrantable, as that means was which the <hi>Jewes</hi> then made use of, in seeking help from forreign Nations, from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> which God had expresly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den them to do.

And the like course are Gods people to take, fore-seeing his judgements a coming upon the Nation, or place where they live, they are by faith to enter into the Chambers of his Protection, and committing themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, quietly to wait for his salvation. Thus did <hi>Noah,</hi> fore-seeing the <hi>Deluge</hi> which was coming upon the world, he with his family entered into the <hi>Ark,</hi> according as God had directed him, Gen. 7.17. there abiding and riding it out, though having neither Saile, Rudder, nor An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor to make use of until the Flood was abated, and the dry land appeared for him to land upon. And the like did the <hi>Israelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> (to whose practise that Text of the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> is conceived to allude;) Having warning of the destroying Angels passing through the Land, they kept close within their houses; Exod. 12.12. And the like let the Lords people do in the like cases. Fore-seeing publick Judgements a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, let them betake themselves to the Ark of divine protection, retiring themselves, seeking God by unfeigned humiliation and repentance, so quietly waiting for the <hi>day of his power,</hi> the time when he will put forth his strength in suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couring and relieving them.</p>

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:192573:100"/>them. So it was with churlish <hi>Nabal,</hi> who when <hi>David</hi> being in the Wildernesse, and wanting provisions for himself and his followers, sent his Messengers to him to crave some relief, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns him this Answer, <hi>Who is David, and who is the Son of Jesse? &amp;c. Shall I take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men that I know not whence they be?</hi> 1 Sam. 25.11. Such <hi>Nabals</hi> there are too many every where, men who <hi>live in prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> (as he is said to do v. 6.) abounding in what the world can afford them, yet let a <hi>David</hi> make his addresse to them, he may as soon draw water out of a flint, as find relief from them. Let it not be charged upon any of you. Remembring what your Saviour tells you in that known Text, Matth. 25. that he will say at that great day, <hi>when he shall come in his glory, and all his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels with him, and shall sit upon the throne of his glory;</hi> what he will then say to those on his <hi>right hand,</hi> and what to those on his <hi>left.</hi> To the one, <hi>Come yee blessed of my Father, inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome prepared for you from the foundation of the world; For I was a hungred and ye gave me meat, and I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink,</hi> &amp;c. v. 34, 35. But to the other, <hi>Depart from me ye cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels; for I was a hungred, and ye gave me no meat, I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink,</hi> &amp;c. v. 41, 42. which in what sense he shall speak it, he there expounds, v. 40, 45. <hi>In as much as ye have done it</hi> (or <hi>not done it) unto the least of these my brethren, yee have done it</hi> (or
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:192573:100"/>
                  <hi>not done it) unto me.</hi> Those who will shew no mercy to their Brethren here, how can they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect mercy from God here, or hereafter? But I shall not enlarge.</p>

                  <note place="margin">In their spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual weaknesses bearing with them, and strengthening them.</note> Being <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,</hi> let us <hi>bear with them,</hi> and <hi>bear them. We that are strong, ought to bear the infirmities of the weak,</hi> Rom. 15.1. Not <hi>taking offence</hi> at them. Much lesse <hi>giving offence</hi> to them, by <hi>casting stumbling blocks</hi> in their way, <hi>wounding their weak Consciences;</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> was very tender and wary of, as he tells his <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.13. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if meat make my brother to offend, I will cat no flesh whilest the world standeth, lest I make my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to offend.</hi> And such respect have we to our weak brethren, rather abstaining from things law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, not being necessary; then by the use of them to give offence unto their weak consciences, <hi>It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak,</hi> Rom. 14.21. And whilest we take heed of being accessary to their falling, now far be it from us to <hi>rejoyce in,</hi> or <hi>making any advantage of</hi> their falls. But being fallen, put forth our hand and do what we can to raise them up. <hi>Brethren</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such a one with the Spirit of meeknesse,</hi> Gal. 6.1. Thus let the <hi>strong</hi> help the <hi>weak.</hi> Not discouraging or disheartning them, but <hi>comforting</hi> and <hi>strengthening</hi> them. That is one thing which <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts his <hi>Thessalonians</hi> to, 1 Thes. 5.14. <hi>Now we exhort you brethren</hi> (saith
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:192573:101"/>he) &amp;c. <hi>Comfort the feeble minded support the weak.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> calleth upon the Lords people to do the like, Isa. 35.3, 4. <hi>Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirme the feeble knees; Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not.</hi> Thus he willeth, as Gods <hi>Prophets,</hi> his <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> in special, who are by their Office (as you have heard) <hi>Sons of Consolation;</hi> so all other true believers, to be thus officious and helpful each to other, comforting and strengthening their weak brethren, whose hearts and spirits are ready to faint under the sense and apprehension of their own weaknesse; or by reason of any evils felt or feared; by acquainting them with Gods promises, their own experiences, so ministring to them what <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials</hi> may be proper for them, for the supporting and strengthening them. This doth our God for us; In our <hi>weaknesse</hi> he putteth forth his <hi>power,</hi> then <hi>making his strength perfect.</hi> And the like do we to others, as God shall give ability and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. And thus have I now, through the assistance of <hi>divine grace,</hi> and <hi>strength made perfect in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> done with this useful <hi>Subject,</hi> which having finished, I shall now make use of <hi>Pauls</hi> farewel to his Brethren at <hi>Miletum,</hi> Acts 20.32. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance among all them which are sanctified.</hi>
